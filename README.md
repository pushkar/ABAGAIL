=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pushkar/ABAGAIL.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pushkar/ABAGAIL)

The library contains a number of interconnected Java packages that implement machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. These are artificial intelligence algorithms implemented for the kind of people that like to implement algorithms themselves.
